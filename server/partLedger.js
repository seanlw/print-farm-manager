// Part quantity ledger: the audit trail behind parts.completed_qty.
//
// Every change to parts.completed_qty goes through adjustPartQty(), which runs the
// UPDATE and appends one ledger row in the same transaction. The ledger is written
// only from inside the events that already change the count (a FINISHED transition,
// an operator confirmation, a mark-failed, a manual edit), so it cannot credit
// anything on its own and cannot double-fire across restarts or reconnects: it
// records exactly the changes the existing code paths make, no more.
//
// server/tests/part-ledger-guard.test.js scans the server source and fails if any
// other file writes completed_qty directly, so a new path cannot silently skip the
// ledger.
//
// Rows are append-only. They are deleted only together with their part (part or
// project delete, backup restore). There are deliberately no FK constraints: printers
// can be deleted while their history stays (printer_name is a snapshot for that
// reason), and a missed cleanup must never turn a part delete into a 500.

// Every source value a ledger row can carry. The client maps these to labels.
